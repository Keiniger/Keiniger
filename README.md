## 📚 College assignments
### [System design](https://github.com/Keiniger/TP-Diseno-de-Sistemas)
  - Made with C#, HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript and MySQL. It's completely responsive. It was the result of a year-long assignment, developed with a 5 person team. I was involved in the Front End using Razor Pages and Bootstrap, the Back End, using Entity Framework and MySQL. I developed the interaction between Mercadolibre and REST APIs, and I was also involved in the login system.
### [Operating systems](https://github.com/Keiniger/TP-Sistemas-Operativos)
  - Made with C, Makefiles and Linux Scripting. It was a four month assignment, developed with a group of five people. I was in charge of the asynchronous code between processes through semaphores, and the deadlock detection of those same processes.
### [Database management](https://github.com/Keiniger/TP-Gestion-de-Datos)
  - Made with SQL Server and PL-SQL. It was a four month long assignment developed with four people. I was in charge of the design of the database, the migration and the PL-SQL scripting.
